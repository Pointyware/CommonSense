# Common Sense
This project attempts to eliminate conflict by finding *the* common sense of reality inevitably shared by all inhabitants of physical reality by focusing on the differences in individual world senses as a way to calibrate the instruments of our lived experiences. 

## A poem
The common sense of "common" used in "common sense" today,</br>is not the same old sharing sense that since did fade away.

  <summary>Extended Original</summary>
The sense of “common” found,</br>
in “common sense” today,</br>
is not the common sense,</br>
which since did fade away;</br>
—</br>
A “common space” or “common place”,</br>
is still a place to gather,</br>
and with a quite uncommon sense,</br>
both mean “shared” together.</br>
—</br>
And now it’s clear, may-be you see,</br>
when used without a care,</br>
concepts mingle – plain as day –</br>
a thing, if shared: not rare.</br>
—</br>
The phrase today, when used to say</br>
“you’re wrong” – not simply rude,</br>
consider now, the way it’s used,</br>
is clearly to exclude.
