# Common Sense
This project attempts to eliminate conflict by finding *the* common sense of reality inevitably shared by all inhabitants of physical reality by focusing on the differences in individual world senses as a way to calibrate the instruments of our lived experiences.

## Purpose
In Ontology, an individual's sense of the world can be described formally and documented as an ontology.
* "Ontology", when used in the uncountable sense, refers to a critical field of philosophy that underlies just about all others; epistemology is considered more fundamental by some, but it's most practical to think of them working together.
* "Ontology", when used in the countable sense, refers to a specific way of thinking about the structure of reality around us.
* "Epistemology" is the study of knowledge – what can be known and how.

Ontology and Epistemology together allow us to explore these world senses and eliminate the differences in our interpretations, which can be seen as errors in our accumulated perception. Our "knowledge", and thus perception, of the world around us is gathered gradually over time through experience, and we permit or reject new "knowledge" on the basis of prior accepted knowledge. This results in massively divergent models of the same shared reality. Naturally, each of our experiences is subjective, and so we are largely limited in our expressive ability to subjective statements; however, the subjectiveness of our experience and statements can be made more objective by simply contextualizing our statements outside of ourselves.

### A poem
The common sense of "common" used in "common sense" today,</br>is not the same old sharing sense that since did fade away.

  <summary>Extended Original</summary>
The sense of “common” found,</br>
in “common sense” today,</br>
is not the common sense,</br>
which since did fade away;</br>
—</br>
A “common space” or “common place”,</br>
is still a place to gather,</br>
and with a quite uncommon sense,</br>
both mean “shared” together.</br>
—</br>
And now it’s clear, may-be you see,</br>
when used without a care,</br>
concepts mingle – plain as day –</br>
a thing, if shared: not rare.</br>
—</br>
The phrase today, when used to say</br>
“you’re wrong” – not simply rude,</br>
consider now, the way it’s used,</br>
is clearly to exclude.

### Agents' Responsibilities
When one agent introduces information to another agent that presents a conflict to the second agent's model of the world, the second agent will usually want to deny the information presented; that would demonstrate bad faith in the first agent, and it would be more productive to instead investigate the source of the divergence. When presented with a conceptual conflict, don't contradict – investigate.
